/**
 * 
 * This metric measures the energy efficiency of a Data Center. It quantifies how much energy the Data Center computing equipments consume from the
 * total energy consumption. It is computed as shown in Equation below:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *    DCiE = IT Equipment Power / Total Facility Power. <br/>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The IT Equipment Power is defined as the power consumed by equipments that are used to manage, process, store or route data within the compute
 * space. The Total Facility Power is defined as the power measured at the utility meter. It includes all IT Equipments plus everything that supports
 * the Data Center computing equipments load such as: UPS, PDUs, computer room air conditioning units (CRACâ€™s), Data Center lightening, among others.
